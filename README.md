# Terraform
**This is a single availability zone AWS Cloud Architecture I build as a developement environment with a developement EC2 instance and Docker pre-installed by using a bash scripting to install both Docker and Terraform in my Development Server.** <br/>
**This makes it easy for developers to seamlessly ssh into an EC2 instance in the Development server created on AWS with vscode.**
