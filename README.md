# Terraform
**This is a single availability zone AWS Cloud Architecture I build as a developement environment with a developement EC2 instance and Docker pre-installed by using bootstrapping.** <br/>
**This makes it easy for developers to seamlessly ssh into an EC2 instance in the cloud with vscode and developement without stress.**
